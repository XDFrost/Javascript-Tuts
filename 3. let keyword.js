// let can be used to declare a variable
// We'll mostly use let keyword
// We can't declare the same variable again using let



let firstname = "Luffy";
// let firstname = "zoro";                //Gives error because we are letting the same variable name
firstname = "zoro";                       //Value inside the variable gets changed
console.log(firstname);












// DIFFERENCE BETWEEN let AND var:
// We can use the same variable name in var again and again but we can't use the same variable name in let
